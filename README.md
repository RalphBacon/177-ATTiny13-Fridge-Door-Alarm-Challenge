Can I squeeze the code from my current, working Fridge Door Alarm (Arduino Nano) into the miniscule ATTiny13 which has just 1024 bytes of Flash memory and 64 bytes of SRAM?

What code compromises to I have to make? Can I use the standard Arduino syntax or do I have to drop down a level to C++? Any hardware changes? Does it provide ALL the functionality of my existing system?

Keep watching to find out the answers to these and many other questions!
